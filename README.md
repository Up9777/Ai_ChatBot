# Build Your Own AI Clone

A Streamlit-based web application for an AI chatbot powered by Groq, LangChain, and ChromaDB. This project allows you to interact with a personalized AI assistant with a sleek UI and persistent conversation history.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the AI Clone chatbot on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **pip**: Python package manager
- **Git**: For cloning the repository
- A **Groq API Key**: Obtain one from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys)
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

### 📥 Installation & Setup

#### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

#### Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows, use:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

This isolates dependencies and prevents conflicts with other projects.

#### Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is missing, you can manually install the core dependencies:

```bash
pip install streamlit langchain langchain-huggingface langchain-groq sentence-transformers chromadb
```

#### Set Up the Groq API Key

The application requires a Groq API key to function. Set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
```

On Windows, use:

```bash
set GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
```

Replace `your-groq-api-key` with your actual key from Groq. Alternatively, you can hardcode the key in `app.py` (not recommended for security reasons).

#### Run the Streamlit App

Launch the application with:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open automatically in your default browser at:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Streamlit**: Web app framework for the UI
- **LangChain**: For managing LLM interactions
- **Groq**: API for the LLaMA3 model
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database for knowledge storage
- **Sentence Transformers**: For text embeddings
- **Python**: Core programming language

## ⚙️ Usage

- **Interact with the Chatbot**: Type your questions in the text input field and click "Send" to get responses from the AI.
- **Clear Chat History**: Use the "Clear Chat History" button in the sidebar to reset the conversation.
- **Persistent Storage**: Conversation data is stored in memory (session state) and embeddings are saved in `chroma_db/`.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **ModuleNotFoundError**: Ensure all dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`). If errors persist, verify your Python version (3.8+) and virtual environment.
- **ChromaDB Errors**: If you see SQLite-related issues, ensure your environment supports `pysqlite3`. Install it manually if needed:

  ```bash
  pip install pysqlite3
  ```

- **Groq API Key Issues**: Verify your API key is set correctly. If you get authentication errors, check [Groq’s documentation](https://console.groq.com/docs).
- **Port Conflict**: If `localhost:8501` is in use, Streamlit will prompt you to choose another port.
